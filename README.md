# React TypeScript Projects

## Introduction

Working on creating separate React Projects with TypeScript to ensure I have mastery of TypeScript over JavaScript for React. Although similar there are significant differences that one must be aware of when working within TypeScript.

## Projects

- [Guess a Number](./guessANumber): A React.TS project where you play against the Machine on guessing a number. The game will display a record of your previous guesses and whether your current guess was correct, too high, or too low.

- [Pokemon Theme](./react-pokemon): A page where uppon the user clicking a button a series of 6 pokemon cards are displayed for the user to utilize as their Pokemon Theme.
