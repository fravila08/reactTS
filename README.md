# React TypeScript Projects

This repository contains a collection of projects built with React and TypeScript. The aim is to master the use of TypeScript in React applications, understanding its benefits and nuances compared to JavaScript. Each project demonstrates different aspects and techniques of React development with TypeScript, highlighting the significant differences and best practices.

## Why TypeScript?

TypeScript enhances JavaScript by adding static type definitions, which can improve code quality and maintainability. By working on these projects, I aim to:

- Deepen my understanding of TypeScript's features and capabilities.
- Learn how to leverage TypeScript to write more robust and error-free React applications.
- Explore the differences and advantages of using TypeScript over JavaScript in React development.

Feel free to explore the projects and provide any feedback or suggestions. Happy coding!

## Projects

- [Guess a Number](./guessNumber/): A React TypeScript project where you play against the machine in guessing a number. The game keeps a record of your previous guesses and provides feedback on whether your current guess is correct, too high, or too low.

- [Pokemon Theme](./react-pokemon/): A React TypeScript project that generates a series of 6 Pokémon cards upon a button click. Users can use these cards to create their own Pokémon theme.

- [Rick and Morty Landing Site](./rick-morty/): A React TypeScript project designed to encourage users to watch the Rick and Morty show. This site features fun facts about the show, lists episodes with links to stream specific shows, and displays characters from the series. Users can add up to 6 favorite characters or up to 6 favorite episodes to their personal list.
