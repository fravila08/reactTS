- CharactersPage.jsx should render a Card BootStrap Component (displaying image and information of said character) for every character within the [Rick and Morty API](https://rickandmortyapi.com/)
  - Maybe use useState, useEffect, axios, async, map, conditional rendering?
- Routes for each page mentioned above within Reacts Browser Router
- NotFound.jsx should render an error message letting the user know this page does not exist
