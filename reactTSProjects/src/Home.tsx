    <p>
      My name is Francisco Avila! I'm a Full-Stack Software engineer with 2 years of experience now.
      I'm currently expanding my React capabilities by writing some old projects in TypeScript vs JavaScript
      which has been really helpful overall and to be completely honest a definite liking for TypeScript over
      JavaScript has been formed haha. Please take a look at the following Projects within the footer.

export default Home;
